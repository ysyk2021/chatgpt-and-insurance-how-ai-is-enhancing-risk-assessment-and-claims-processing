These factors can make it difficult for insurers to accurately assess risk and process claims efficiently.

Common Challenges Faced by Insurance Companies

Some of the common challenges faced by insurance companies include:

Ultimately, customer satisfaction is crucial for insurers to retain customers and build a strong reputation in the industry.
