Different levels of coverage are available, ranging from basic liability insurance to comprehensive coverage that includes protection against various risks.

Flood insurance protects against property damage and losses resulting from floods, which are typically not covered by standard homeowners or renters insurance policies. It is particularly important for individuals residing in flood-prone areas.
